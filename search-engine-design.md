Designing a scalable architecture for a web search engine involves breaking down the entire process into manageable components that can handle large amounts of data efficiently. Let’s explain this step by step using pseudocode to keep it simple.

### 1. **Crawling** (Getting Web Pages)
We need to gather and store web pages from the internet. This is done by a "crawler."

#### Pseudocode for the Crawler:
```
// Start with a list of URLs (called seeds)
queue_of_urls = ["https://example.com", "https://another-example.com"]

visited_urls = {}  // A dictionary to store the URLs we have visited

// Crawl function to visit a URL and find new links
function crawl(url):
    if url not in visited_urls:
        // Fetch the content of the URL
        page_content = fetch_page(url)

        // Parse the page content to find new URLs (links on the page)
        new_urls = extract_links(page_content)

        // Add new URLs to the queue (only if not already visited)
        for new_url in new_urls:
            if new_url not in visited_urls:
                queue_of_urls.push(new_url)

        // Mark the current URL as visited
        visited_urls[url] = True

// Continuously crawl until the queue is empty or we set a limit
while queue_of_urls is not empty:
    current_url = queue_of_urls.pop()
    crawl(current_url)
```

### 2. **Indexing** (Storing Web Pages Efficiently)
Once we’ve crawled a web page, we need to store its important content (e.g., words, titles) in a way that makes it fast to search.

#### Pseudocode for the Indexer:
```
// Initialize the index (a dictionary to store words and the URLs they appear in)
index = {}

function index_page(url, page_content):
    words = extract_words(page_content)  // Get all words from the page

    for word in words:
        // If the word is not in the index, add it with an empty list
        if word not in index:
            index[word] = []

        // Add the URL to the list of pages where this word appears
        if url not in index[word]:
            index[word].append(url)

// Index each crawled page
for url in visited_urls:
    page_content = get_page_content(url)  // Assume we store page content somewhere
    index_page(url, page_content)
```

### 3. **Ranking** (Finding the Best Results)
When a user searches for something, we need to return the most relevant results. A basic ranking can be done using a concept like "PageRank" or the number of times a word appears on a page.

#### Pseudocode for Ranking:
```
// Function to rank search results
function rank_results(search_term):
    matching_pages = index[search_term]  // Get all pages with the search term
    ranked_pages = []

    for page in matching_pages:
        // Get the page content and count how many times the search term appears
        page_content = get_page_content(page)
        word_count = count_occurrences(search_term, page_content)

        // Add the page to ranked results with its score (higher score is better)
        ranked_pages.push((page, word_count))

    // Sort the pages by the word_count in descending order (best match first)
    ranked_pages.sort_by(word_count, descending=True)

    return ranked_pages
```

### 4. **Query Handling** (Searching the Index)
When the user types a query, we search through the index and return the best-ranked results.

#### Pseudocode for Search Function:
```
// Function to handle a search query
function search(query):
    words_in_query = split_query_into_words(query)  // Break the query into words
    results = {}

    for word in words_in_query:
        if word in index:
            word_results = rank_results(word)  // Rank the results for this word
            results[word] = word_results

    return results  // Return the ranked search results for each word
```

### 5. **Scaling** (Making It Efficient for Millions of Users)
To make the system scalable, we can:
- **Distribute the crawler**: Have multiple crawlers running on different machines to fetch more pages faster.
- **Shard the index**: Store parts of the index on different servers (e.g., A-M words on one server, N-Z on another).
- **Use caching**: Store results of popular queries so we don’t have to re-rank every time.
- **Load balancing**: Use multiple servers to handle search requests and balance the load.

#### Pseudocode for Scaling:
```
// Distribute crawling across multiple machines
machines = ["machine1", "machine2", "machine3"]
function distribute_crawl():
    for machine in machines:
        send_crawler(machine)  // Send a crawler to each machine

// Shard the index across multiple machines
function shard_index():
    index_shards = {"A-M": machine1, "N-Z": machine2}

    for word in index:
        first_letter = get_first_letter(word)
        if first_letter in "A-M":
            send_to_machine(index[word], machine1)
        else:
            send_to_machine(index[word], machine2)
```

### Summary of Architecture
1. **Crawler**: Collects web pages.
2. **Indexer**: Extracts and stores important words and their locations.
3. **Ranker**: Sorts results based on relevance.
4. **Query Handling**: Processes user searches.
5. **Scaling**: Uses multiple servers and caching for speed and efficiency.

By breaking each task into smaller parts and distributing them across multiple machines, we can make our search engine scalable and fast for millions of users!
