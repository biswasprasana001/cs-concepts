Sure! Designing a scalable architecture for a web search engine involves creating a system that can handle a large number of users and a vast amount of data efficiently. Here's a simple approach:

### Key Components:
1. **Web Crawler**: Collects data from web pages.
2. **Indexer**: Organizes and stores the data for quick retrieval.
3. **Query Processor**: Handles user search queries and retrieves relevant results.
4. **Ranking Algorithm**: Ranks the search results based on relevance.
5. **Distributed Storage**: Stores the data across multiple servers for scalability.

### Pseudocode Example:

#### Web Crawler:
```plaintext
function web_crawler(start_urls):
    urls_to_crawl = start_urls
    visited_urls = set()
    while urls_to_crawl is not empty:
        url = urls_to_crawl.pop(0)
        if url not in visited_urls:
            content = fetch_page(url)
            visited_urls.add(url)
            links = extract_links(content)
            for link in links:
                if link not in visited_urls:
                    urls_to_crawl.append(link)
            send_to_indexer(url, content)
```

#### Indexer:
```plaintext
function indexer(url, content):
    words = extract_words(content)
    for word in words:
        if word not in index:
            index[word] = []
        index[word].append(url)
```

#### Query Processor:
```plaintext
function query_processor(query):
    words = extract_words(query)
    results = []
    for word in words:
        if word in index:
            results.extend(index[word])
    ranked_results = rank_results(results)
    return ranked_results
```

#### Ranking Algorithm:
```plaintext
function rank_results(results):
    ranked_results = []
    for result in results:
        score = calculate_relevance_score(result)
        ranked_results.append((result, score))
    ranked_results.sort_by_score()
    return ranked_results
```

#### Distributed Storage:
```plaintext
function distributed_storage(data):
    # Store data across multiple servers
    server = choose_server(data)
    server.store(data)
```

### Explanation:
- **Web Crawler**: Collects data from web pages and sends it to the indexer.
- **Indexer**: Organizes the data into an index for quick retrieval.
- **Query Processor**: Handles user search queries and retrieves relevant results from the index.
- **Ranking Algorithm**: Ranks the search results based on relevance.
- **Distributed Storage**: Stores the data across multiple servers to handle large amounts of data and users.

### Purpose:
1. **Scalability**: Handle a large number of users and data efficiently.
2. **Efficiency**: Quickly retrieve and rank search results.
3. **Reliability**: Ensure the system can handle failures and continue to operate.
